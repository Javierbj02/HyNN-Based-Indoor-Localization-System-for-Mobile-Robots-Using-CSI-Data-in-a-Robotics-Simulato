Data

In ULA folder, there are the CSI datasets, for 8, 16, 32 and 64 antennas. This datasets are being preproccesed, converted to polar coordinates for the NN training. Due to the large size of the datasets, they can be found in: https://pruebasaluuclm-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/javier_ballesteros_uclm_es/Documents/HyNN-CSI?csf=1&web=1&e=K7ahNy

The rest of folders, represent the experiments done in this project. This three experiments or test cases, has the CSI data associated to the positions of the robot during the route, for different antennas setup and for different noise levels in the data.
