In this folder, we can found the required models. On one hand, we have the HyNN models, which allow us to predict a position from CSI data. On the other hand, we have the image models, which allow us to create synthethic images from data.

We have models for different number of antennas scenarios: 8, 16, 32 and 64. For each scenario, we have two models: one for predicting the X-position, and other for Y-position.

Due to the large size of the models, they can be found at: https://pruebasaluuclm-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/javier_ballesteros_uclm_es/Documents/HyNN-CSI?csf=1&web=1&e=K7ahNy
