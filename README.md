# Hybrid Neural Network-Based Indoor Localization System for Mobile Robots Using CSI Data in a Robotics Simulator

#### This repository contains the source code used to obtain the results in **"Hybrid Neural Network-Based Indoor Localization System for Mobile Robots Using CSI Data in a Robotics Simulator"**.

## Data

In Data, is stored the Data used for the project.

[Data](./Data/)

## Models

In Models, is stored the HyNN models and image models (used for the images creation in real-time).

[Models](./Models/)

## Scripts

In scripts, there are the scripts used for the Data creation and for the HyNN models trainings.

## Experiments

For the evaluation of the proposal, using a robotics simulation tool (webots), some experiments have been designed. It has been necessary to follow a procedure of integration in the simulator for the evaluation, and the implementation in ROS for run the experiments. The results have been stored too, so we can study the evaluation of the proposal. Furthermore, a Kalman filter integration has been studied in the results.
