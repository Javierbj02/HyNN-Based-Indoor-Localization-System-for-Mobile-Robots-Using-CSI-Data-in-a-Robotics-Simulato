In this folder, there are the results obtained after the training of the hybrid neural networks.

The Mean Error results are obtained from combaining both X- and Y-models, using the euclidian distance expression:

$`d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}`$

Where $x_2$ and $y_2$ represents the predicted position by the HyNN model (in validation and test), and $x_1$ and $y_1$ are the real positions.
