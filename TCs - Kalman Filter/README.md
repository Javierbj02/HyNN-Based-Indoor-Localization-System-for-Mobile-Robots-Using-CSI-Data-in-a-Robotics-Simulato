# Source code of the Experiments

In this folder, we find all the source code, and results, of the Experiments done. We have three main experiments or test cases (TC):
- TC1: Uniform rectilinear motion
- TC2: Obstacle avoidance
- TC3: Kidnapping problem

For each experiment, it has been studied the results after integrating a Kalman filter too.
For each experiment, we find 4 noise levels. For each noise level, we find 4 setups (number of antennas).
